# Advanced JS Programming

## Overview

This sprint was divided into two major segments:  
1. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented using JavaScript  
2. **Object-Oriented and Advanced JavaScript concepts**, including asynchronous patterns and prototypes.

---

## Part 1: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

### Focus Areas

- Practiced **linear and non-linear data structures** using JavaScript:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Hash Tables
  - Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
  - Graphs (Adjacency List and Matrix)

- Implemented and tested multiple **algorithms**:
  - Sorting: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort
  - Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
  - Graph Traversal: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search)

- Used both **structured and unstructured data** to simulate real-world problem-solving.

- Applied **design principles** and code modularity across use cases.

## Part 2: Object-Oriented & Advanced JavaScript

### OOP Concepts

- Objects, Classes, Constructors, and Object references
- `this` keyword usage and constructor behavior
- Object methods and conversions (object to primitive)
- Property descriptors, flags, getters/setters
- Prototypes, class inheritance, and extending native prototypes
- Usage of `__proto__`, classes without prototype inheritance

### Advanced Asynchronous Patterns

- Promises and promise chaining
- Promise API (`Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, etc.)
- Custom errors and extending `Error`
- Promisification of callback-based functions
- `async/await` syntax and use cases
- Async iteration and generators

### Additional Concepts

- Currying
- Hoisting
- Callbacks vs Promises
- Microtasks vs Macrotasks
